# QUIC vs TCP/TLS vs HTTPS Protocol Analyzer

A comprehensive network protocol analyzer that compares QUIC, TCP/TLS, and HTTPS performance in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Packet Capture**: Capture and analyze network traffic in real-time
- **Three Protocol Comparison**: QUIC vs TCP/TLS vs HTTPS
- **Advanced Analytics**: Throughput, latency, jitter, efficiency metrics
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Plotly charts with real-time updates
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: 15+ performance indicators per protocol
- **Organized Dashboard**: Tab-based interface for different analysis types

## Protocols Analyzed

1. **QUIC** (Quick UDP Internet Connections)
   - Modern transport protocol
   - Built-in encryption
   - Multiplexed streams
   - Faster connection establishment

2. **TCP/TLS** (Traditional Encrypted Transport)
   - Standard TCP with TLS encryption
   - Reliable ordered delivery
   - Widely supported

3. **HTTPS** (HTTP over TLS)
   - Web traffic analysis
   - TLS handshake detection
   - Application layer metrics

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
